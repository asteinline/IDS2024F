Fastest Component of Computer Memory
The **fastest component** of a computer's memory is the **register memory**, located inside the CPU.

Why Modern Computer Memory is Hierarchical
Modern computer memory is comprised of a **multilevel (hierarchical) structure** because different types of memory have different speeds and costs. Faster memory (e.g., registers, cache) is expensive and smaller in size, while slower memory (e.g., RAM, hard drives) is cheaper and larger. The hierarchy optimizes performance and cost by balancing speed and capacity.

Slowest Kind of Computer Storage Device
The **slowest kind** of computer storage device is the **hard disk drive (HDD)**.

Hierarchy of Memory in Modern Computers
From smallest to largest memory size:
1. **Registers**
2. **L1, L2, L3 Cache**
3. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**
4. **SSD (Solid State Drive)**
5. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**

Smallest Unit of Information in Computers
The smallest unit of information in computers is a **bit** (binary digit: 0 or 1).

Why Binary Numbers (0 and 1) are Used in Computers
Humans have chosen **binary numbers** to represent data in computers because digital circuits can easily and reliably distinguish between two states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**, making binary ideal for physical implementation.

Typical Speed of Computer Memory Registers
The typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers is measured in **nanoseconds (ns)**, usually between **0.5 to 1 ns**, as they are the fastest memory components.

Decade of the First Digital Computer
The first digital computer, **ENIAC**, was built in the **1940s**.

Decade of the First General-Purpose Digital Computer
The first general-purpose digital computer, **ENIAC**, was also built in the **1940s**.

Fixed Program Computer
A **fixed program computer** is a computer designed to execute only a specific set of tasks or applications. It cannot be reprogrammed to perform different tasks.

Example of Modern-Day Fixed Program Computer
An example of a modern-day fixed program computer is a **calculator** or a **microcontroller** in an appliance like a microwave.

Difference Between Declarative and Imperative Knowledge
- **Declarative knowledge** is factual information or statements about **what** something is.
- **Imperative knowledge** is procedural information or instructions on **how** to do something.

Classifying Statements
- (a) **"The letter B is the second letter in the English alphabet."**: This is **declarative knowledge** because it is a factual statement.
- (b) **"Overcast sky conditions are more likely to cause rain."**: This is also **declarative knowledge**, as it describes a relationship or fact.

Class of Human Knowledge Algorithms Belong To
Algorithms belong to the class of **imperative knowledge** because they provide step-by-step instructions on how to solve a problem or perform a task.

Name of the First Digital Computer
The name of the first digital computer is **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer).

Definition of Logarithm
A logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. It answers the question: **What exponent must a given base be raised to in order to get a certain number?**
- For example, if \(2^3 = 8\), then the logarithm of 8 with base 2 is \( \log_2(8) = 3 \), because 2 must be raised to the power of 3 to get 8.

Summation Problem
The summation is \( S = 3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 96 + 99 \).

1. This is an arithmetic sequence with a first term \(a = 3\), a common difference \(d = 3\), and the last term \(l = 99\).
2. The number of terms \(n\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   n = \frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \frac{99 - 3}{3} + 1 = 33
   \]
3. The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   S = \frac{33}{2} \times (3 + 99) = 16.5 \times 102 = 1683
   \]
   
Thus, the value of \(S\) is **1683**.

Strategy:
This is similar to the chessboard problem in that it involves recognizing patterns in a sequence. Here, we used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to efficiently solve the problem.
